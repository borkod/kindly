var checkCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "check",
	Short: "A brief description of your command",
	Long: `A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains examples
and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.`,
	Args: cobra.MinimumNArgs(1),
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		var k kindly.Kindly
		k.SetConfig(cfg)
		k.Check(args)
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(checkCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// checkCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	checkCmd.Flags().BoolP("output", "o", false, "Output YAML spec file.")
	viper.BindPFlag("output", checkCmd.Flags().Lookup("output"))
}
